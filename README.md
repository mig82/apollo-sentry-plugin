# Sentry Plugin

A Sentry Plugin for Apollo Server which implements performance and error tracking.

```ts
import { getApolloSentryPlugin } from 'apollo-sentry-plugin'

// Checks that you have an env var SENTRY_DSN and fails if you don't, or if it's of an invalid syntax.
const apolloSentryPlugin = getApolloSentryPlugin(`My Apollo Server`)

const server = new ApolloServer({
	typeDefs,
	resolvers,
	dataSources,
	csrfPrevention: true,
	// Here we go.
	plugins: [apolloSentryPlugin]
})
```

## Why?

Because while there are a few articles on how to do this, somehow I still found it painful to do it the 
first time around, and I'm a fan of fixing every problem once.
